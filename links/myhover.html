  <p id="aboutmain">I'm Barath.I'm 18 years old,I go to college,to study Engineering. I'm an electrical engineer.I'm passionate about science,technology,electronics and computers. I'm a programmer,web developer,gamer,enthusiast as well as an idiot.Yes,educated idiots do exist :P .Ever since I was a kid,I had the passion to gain knowledge,and get to know things. I've been different from everybody.Even today,I am.You see,we all run a rat race,we see others, we do what others do.We live a mechanical life,we just don't think out of the box.<br> I've been picked on, become the prime target for bullies,got bullied,drugged,abused and... it just goes on,but I'm still fighting.Thank god,he gave me the brains to realize this and come out of it. And the one thing that motivates me,is to "NOT" be like everyone.There are a billion people on earth.Don't be one of that "billion", but be one in a billion. Science and technology fascinated me,and hence brought me all the way to where I am today.I thank my parents,teachers, girlfriend(imaginary of course :P nah nah just kidding,I don't have one) and finally,god almighty himself.<br><br>
